I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Technology at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), pursuing my doctoral degree from September 2021 to June 2027 (expected graduation). My research interests focus on computer vision, with specific emphases on HDR and aesthetic assessment. I am jointly supervised by Prof. Huiyuan Fu (National Young Talent, Beijing Distinguished Young Scholar), Prof. Huadong Ma (Changjiang Scholar, National Distinguished Young Scholar, IEEE Fellow), and Prof. Xin Wang from Stony Brook University.
